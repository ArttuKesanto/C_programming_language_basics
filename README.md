# c_programming_language_basics
This repository consists of work that covers the basics of programming in C. Technologies used are Visual Studio Code (a popular code editor) and compilers for C, specifically gcc (with Apple's command line developer tools). Course is part of Metropolia University of Applied Science's basic courses in relation to programming.

## Notes about the tasks:
Some of the tasks contain Finnish, as this is the only way in which Viope accepts the work provided here (an external website that checks that the code has been correctly written - a course requisite). The folders here contain the code written in *"something".c*-files, and the compiled executables can be found within this repository as well. If one wants to only run the finished code, it is possible to do so:

1. Navigate to the folder (terminal on MacOS, for example).
2. Run the compiled code, input the following in the terminal: *./runme*.
